                <p>Austin police identified the person shot and killed by an officer on Monday in Northeast Austin as David Joseph, 17. Police also identified the officer involved in the shooting as Geoffrey Freeman, a veteran officer who joined the force in 2005. “All of our officer-involved shootings are tragedies,” Austin police Chief of Staff Brian Manley said. Concurrent investigations are underway, Manley said, including a criminal investigation being conducted by the Special Investigations Unit and the district attorney’s office. Manley confirmed that Joseph was unarmed when he was shot Monday morning. Police had responded to a call in the 300 block of Yager Lane that a man was chasing someone through an apartment complex, Manley said. Officer Freeman had been talking to witnesses when he responded to a call nearby in the 12000 block of Natures Bend, he said. There, Freeman encountered Joseph and within seconds of the confrontation, he opened fire, Manley said. Freeman provided an initial statement at the scene but is expected to provide a more lengthy statement for investigators later this week, Manley said. Manley declined to talk about whether the victim had any previous police record or a history of mental illnesss.“Now is not the day,” he said.</p>
